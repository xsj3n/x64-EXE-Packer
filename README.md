# x64-EXE-Packer
## A software packer for 64 bit Windows exes. An exploratory project.
The goal is to have a stub file decrypt an exe image from one of it's sections and then running the image that was contained within.

As of now, a working stub which is nothing more than a loader at the moment has been added.
