# x64-EXE-Packer
## A software packer for 64 bit Windows exes. An exploratory project.

Progress:
- [x] Stub 
- [x] Packer
- [ ] Custom Cipher

The packer & stub currently function as a software loader, all that's left is to add encryption. Custom cipher is mostly done, yet the cipher must be tested a bit more before implementation.
